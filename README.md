# Dataset Cleaning and Processing for Grading Application
This Python program is designed for cleaning and analyzing student data stored in a CSV file. It performs various data cleaning tasks, such as adjusting NIM (Student ID) format, handling missing values, correcting anomalies, and calculating statistical measures.

## Features
- Cleans and organizes student data from a CSV file.
- Removes duplicate records based on NIM.
- Converts letter grades in the dataset to numerical equivalents.
- Calculates means, medians, and standard deviations for different assignment types.
- Identifies and analyzes outliers in the dataset.
- Provides insights into high and low-performing students based on specific criteria.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repo_link]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [directory_location]`
3. Run the program: `python [python_file]`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the location of the CSV file and review the results.

## Dependencies
This project requires only Python to be installed. No additional external libraries are used.

## Results
After running the program, the cleaned dataset will be saved to a file named 'datasetunyu_fixed.csv'. Additionally, the program generates a 'hasil' file containing statistical measures and data analysis results.
